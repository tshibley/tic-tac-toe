# Tic-Tac-Toe Coding Challenge

Welcome to the tic-tac-toe coding challenge! This is a React application that implements a classic tic-tac-toe game.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser** and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`)

## The Challenge

This tic-tac-toe game has some issues that need to be identified and fixed. Your task is to:

1. **Run the application** and play a few games to understand how it works
2. **Identify the bugs** by testing different scenarios and edge cases
3. **Fix the bugs** you find
4. **Test your fixes** to ensure the game works correctly

## What to Look For

- Test the basic game functionality (placing X's and O's)
- Try the "New Game" button
- Play complete games and check win detection
- Test edge cases and unusual scenarios
- Look for visual issues with the game board

## Development Tips

- Use the browser's developer tools to inspect the application
- Check the console for any error messages
- Test systematically - try different game scenarios
- Don't be afraid to explore the code structure

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── App.jsx          # Main game component
├── App.css          # Game styling
├── main.jsx         # Application entry point
└── index.css        # Global styles
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

Good luck with the challenge!
